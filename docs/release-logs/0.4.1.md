# LiteFX 0.4.1 - Alpha 04

- New event infrastructure. ([See PR #81](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/81))
- Debugging improvements: ([See PR #82](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/82))
  - Add support for user-defined debug markers. 
  - Use official PIX event runtime for DX12 x64 debug builds.
  - `VK_EXT_debug_utils` is now enabled by default for the Vulkan backend in debug builds.
- Improved resource allocation and binding: ([See PR #83](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/83))
  - Resources can now be created without querying the descriptor set layout or descriptor layout in advance.
  - When allocating descriptor sets, default bindings can be provided to make bind-once scenarios more straightforward.
