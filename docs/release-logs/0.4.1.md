- New event infrastructure. ([See PR #81](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/81))
- Debugging improvements: ([See PR #82](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/82))
  - Add support for user-defined debug markers. 
  - Use official PIX event runtime for DX12 x64 debug builds.
  - `VK_EXT_debug_utils` is now enabled by default for the Vulkan backend in debug builds.
- Improved resource allocation and binding: ([See PR #83](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/83))
  - Resources can now be created without querying the descriptor set layout or descriptor layout in advance.
  - When allocating descriptor sets, default bindings can be provided to make bind-once scenarios more straightforward.
- Raise minimum Vulkan SDK version to 1.3.204.1. ([See PR #86](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/86) and [See PR #88](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/88))
- Make most of the render pipeline state dynamic. ([See PR #86](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/86))
- Vector conversion to math types can now be done for constant vectors. ([See PR #87](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/87))
- Minor fix where it was previously possible to allocate images with a dimension of 0. ([See PR #90](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/90))
