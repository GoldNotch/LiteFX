# LiteFX 0.4.1 - Alpha 04

- New event infrastructure. ([See PR #81](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/81))
- Debugging improvements: ([See PR #82](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/82))
  - Add support for user-defined debug markers. 
  - DirectX 12 ‚ùé: Use official PIX event runtime for DX12 x64 debug builds.
  - Vulkan üåã: `VK_EXT_debug_utils` is now enabled by default for the Vulkan backend in debug builds.
- Improved resource allocation and binding: ([See PR #83](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/83))
  - Resources can now be created without querying the descriptor set layout or descriptor layout in advance.
  - When allocating descriptor sets, default bindings can be provided to make bind-once scenarios more straightforward.
- Improved handling of temporary command buffers. ([See PR #89](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/89))
  - Command buffers can now be submitted with shared ownership to a command queue, which then stores them and releases the references, if the submit fence is passed (during `waitFor`).
  - Command buffer transfers can now receive resources with shared ownership. Resource references are released in a similar fashion.
  - To share ownership, the `asShared` function can be used.
- Vulkan üåã: Raise minimum Vulkan SDK version to 1.3.204.1. ([See PR #86](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/86) and [See PR #88](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/88))
- Make most of the render pipeline state dynamic (viewports, scissors, ...). ([See PR #86](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/86))
- Vector conversion to math types can now be done for constant vectors. ([See PR #87](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/87))
- Backend types now import contra-variant interface functions instead of hiding them. ([See PR #91](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/91))
- Fix üêû: Image dimensions are always clamped to a minimum of 1, so that resources with zero-dimensions are created. ([See PR #90](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/90))
