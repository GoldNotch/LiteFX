# LiteFX 0.3.1 - Alpha 03

- Various API improvements ([See PR #66](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/66))
  - Remove circular dependencies from constructors, to make it easier to opt-out of the builder architecture.
  - Split up builders to encourage re-using pipeline layouts, shader programs and fixed-function states.
  - Root builders now provide a move-conversion operator, eliminating the need to call `.go` explicitly.
  - Child builders use other naming convention for `.go` (`.add`) to improve readability.
- Backend and device states help to automatically manage resources over multiple backend instances. ([See PR #66](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/66))
- Backends can now be switched at runtime. Samples have been updated to work on both backends, if they are built. ([See PR #66](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/66))
- Pipeline layouts can now be defined using shader reflection. ([See PR #68](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/68))
- Vulkan 🌋: If the DX12 backend is available, the Vulkan uses an interop swap chain to support flip-model swap effects for lower latencies. ([See PR #66](https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX/pull/66))
