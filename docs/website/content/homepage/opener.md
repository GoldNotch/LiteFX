Welcome to LiteFX ✨ - An extensible, descriptive, modern computer graphics and rendering engine, written in C++20. 

This engine is an educational project, I've written to teach myself about modern computer graphics APIs, including Vulkan 🌋 and DirectX 12 ❎. It contains an abstraction layer over both back-ends that can be configured through a fluent interface, making it possible to easily and quickly express render pipeline configurations. It uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) to resolve dependencies and supports custom shader targets (written in HLSL or GLSL), allowing you to setup a basic, fully featured rendering application within seconds.

More updates and public release will be announced soon. Stay tuned! 🚀
