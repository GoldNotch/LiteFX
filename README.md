## About

LiteFX is a computer graphics engine, I've developed to learn about modern graphics APIs, like Vulkan üåã and DirectX 12 ‚ùé. It follows an descriptive approach, which means that an application focuses on configuring what it needs and the engine then takes care of handling those requirements. To do this, the API provides a fluent interface. Here is an example of how to easily define a Vulkan graphics pipeline with a few lines of code:

```cxx
m_renderPass = m_device->buildRenderPass()
    .attachTarget(RenderTargetType::Present, Format::B8G8R8A8_SRGB, MultiSamplingLevel::x1, { 0.f, 0.f, 0.f, 0.f }, true, false, false)
    .addPipeline(0, "Basic")
        .withViewport(makeShared<Viewport>(RectF(0.f, 0.f, 800.f, 600.f)))
        .withScissor(makeShared<Scissor>(RectF(0.f, 0.f, 800.f, 600.f)))
        .layout()
            .shaderProgram()
                .addVertexShaderModule("shaders/basic.vert.spv")
                .addFragmentShaderModule("shaders/basic.frag.spv")
                .go()
            .addDescriptorSet(DescriptorSets::PerFrame, ShaderStage::Vertex | ShaderStage::Fragment)
                .addUniform(0, sizeof(CameraBuffer))
                .go()
        .rasterizer()
            .withPolygonMode(PolygonMode::Solid)
            .withCullMode(CullMode::BackFaces)
            .withCullOrder(CullOrder::ClockWise)
            .withLineWidth(1.f)
            .go()
        .inputAssembler()
            .withTopology(PrimitiveTopology::TriangleList)
            .withIndexType(IndexType::UInt16)
            .addVertexBuffer(sizeof(Vertex), 0)
                .addAttribute(0, BufferFormat::XYZ32F, offsetof(Vertex, Position))
                .addAttribute(1, BufferFormat::XYZW32F, offsetof(Vertex, Color))
                .go()
            .go()
        .go()
    .go();
```

The core of the fluent interface is a flexible [builder architecture](https://github.com/Aschratt/LiteFX/wiki/builder-guide), that allows to easily extent built-in types provide custom implementations. Furthermore it also allows to provide whole custom rendering backends.

LiteFX is written in modern C++17, following established design patterns to make it easy to learn and adapt. It's focus is make the performance of modern graphics APIs easily accessible, whilst retaining full flexibility.

## Installation

If you just want to start using LiteFX, you can acquire binaries of the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/Aschratt/LiteFX/releases).

### Manual Builds

You can also build the sources on your own. Currently only MSVC builds under Windows are supported. However, the engine does use CMake with the Ninja generator, so porting non platform-specific parts should be absolutely possible (pull requests are much appreciated!).

#### Prerequisites

In order for the project to be built, there are a few prerequisites that need to be present on your environment:

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (version 3.16 or higher).
- Optional: [LunarG Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) 1.2.148.0 or later (required to build the Vulkan backend).
- Optional: Custom [DXC](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler) build (required to build shaders for DirectX backend). ‚Ä†
- Optional: Windows 10 SDK 10.0.19041.0 or later (required to build DirectX backend).

‚Ä† Note that the LunarG Vulkan SDK (1.2.141.0 and above) ships with a pre-built DXC binary, so you might want to install it, even if you only want to target the DirectX backend. Alternatively, you can download a pre-build DXC distribution.

#### Cloning the Repository

Create a new directory from where you want to build the sources. Then open your shell and clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/crud89/LiteFX.git . --recurse-submodules
```

#### Performing a Build

There are multiple ways of creating a build from scratch. In general, all *CMake*-based build systems are supported.

##### From Command Line

Building from command line is the most straightforward way and is typically sufficient, if you only want to consume a fresh build.

```sh
cmake src/ -B out/build/
cmake --build out/build/ --target install --config Release
```

##### Using Visual Studio

From Visual Studio open the folder where you just checked out the contents of the repository. In the *Project Explorer* change the view to *CMake Targets*. Right click *LiteFX* and select *Install*.

#### Build Customization

You can customize the engine build, according to your specific needs. From Visual Studio, you can simply edit the `src/CMakeSettings.json` file to do this. The usual CMake process is similar. All customizable options have the `BUILD_` prefix and are described in detail below:

- `BUILD_VULKAN_BACKEND` (default: `ON`): builds the Vulkan backend üåã (requires [LunarG Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) 1.2.148.0 or later to be installed on your system).
- `BUILD_DX12_BACKEND` (default: `OFF`): builds the DirectX 12 backend ‚ùé
- `BUILD_EXAMPLES` (default: `ON`): builds the examples. Depending on which backends are built, some may be omitted.
- `BUILD_WITH_GLM` (default: `ON`): adds [glm](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html) converters to math types. ‚Ä†
- `BUILD_WITH_DIRECTX_MATH` (default: `ON`): adds [DirectX Math](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXMath) converters to math types. ‚Ä†
- `BUILD_USE_GLSLC` (default: `OFF`): compiles shaders using *glslc* (requires LunarG Vulkan SDK to be installed on your system). **Can not be used together with `BUILD_USE_DXC`!** ‚Ä°
- `BUILD_USE_DXC` (default: `ON`): compiles shaders using *DXC* (requires LunarG Vulkan SDK when targeting only Vulkan, a pre-build of [DXC](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/releases) when targeting only DirectX 12, or a custom DXC build when targeting both). **Can not be used together with `BUILD_USE_GLSLC`!** ‚Ä°
- `BUILD_DXC_DXIL` (default: `ON`): compiles HLSL shaders to DXIL when `BUILD_USE_DXC` is set to `ON`.
- `BUILD_DXC_SPIRV` (default: `ON`): compiles HLSL shaders to SPIR-V when `BUILD_USE_DXC` is set to `ON`.

‚Ä† Note that *glm* and *DirectX Math* are installed using *vcpkg* automatically. If one of those options gets disabled, no converters will be generated and the dependency will not be exported.

‚Ä° *glslc* can be used to compile HLSL and GLSL shaders into SPIR-V for the Vulkan backend. *DXC* can only compile HLSL, but can target SPIR-V and DXIL, that's why it is preferred over *glslc*.
