|   01   | Basic Rendering | This sample shows how to setup a basic renderer using the LiteFX engine. It shows how to create multiple rendering backends and how to switch between them. It also creates the supported backends based on their availability in the build configuration.  The application creates a single render pass that exposes a single render pipeline. A vertex and index buffer is created, as well as a constant/uniform buffer for the camera. Multiple back-buffers are used to draw frames in flight.   **NOTE:** The pre-processor defines might be different when the engine gets imported from CMake. Instead of `BUILD_VULKAN_BACKEND`/`BUILD_DIRECTX_12_BACKEND` you have to use `LITEFX_HAS_VULKAN_BACKEND`/`LITEFX_HAS_DIRECTX12_BACKEND`. |
|   02   | Render Passes   | This sample is an extension of the *Basic Rendering* sample. It shows how to setup multiple render passes and pass results from earlier passes to input attachments of the next pass. In this example, two render passes are created. One draws the geometry as the earlier example. The other one draws a screen-filling quad that samples the color target of the first render pass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|   03   | Push Constants  | This sample demonstrates how to use push constants. Push constants are an efficient way to pass small chunks of data to shaders. Instead of allocating, binding and managing buffers and descriptors, push constants can directly be put on the command buffer. In this example, different versions of the same object are draws and varying positions and with different colors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
